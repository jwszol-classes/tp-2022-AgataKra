This project shows a simulation of an elevator. The elevator operates in a 2D five story building and has a weight limit of 700 kg (or 8 passengers).
The buttons summon people with specific destinations to correct floors. The elevator collects people "on the way" up or down, according to passenger's destinations. People's destinations are matched with color to specific floors.

Agata Kraszewska is responsible for most of the structures, the visual presentation and connecting everyone's work into a working whole. Most of this work is either in the structures created at the top of the draw2 file and in the RepaintWindow function.
Marcin Martychewicz is responsible for the movement of the elevator and updating the position of the elevator and the passengers. Most of this work is present in the elevator_control function.
